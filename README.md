LocusSigma is a very simple plugin for [Locus Map](https://www.locusmap.app/) which provides a shortcut for quickly
exporting tracks into the [SIGMA RIDE](https://sigmasport.com/product/ride-app/) app. Without the plugin, transferring
tracks requires you to export them to a `GPX` file and importing it in SIGMA RIDE via its import menu or a file browser,
both of which is cumbersome as you have to locate the file, particularly if you are out on a ride and need to plan a
new route.

Usage:
- Install [Locus Map](https://www.locusmap.app/), [SIGMA RIDE](https://sigmasport.com/product/ride-app/) and the LocusSigma app.
- In Locus Map, select a track (from the map or Tracks & Routes manager) and tap the 'share' button
- Select `SIGMA RIDE`.
- The track will be automatically imported into SIGMA RIDE and can be directly sent to a connected device.

LocusSigma itself has no settings or other user interface. You can't start it directly from the Android launcher/home screen.
